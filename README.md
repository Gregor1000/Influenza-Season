# Tableau Public
The data analyst course at CareerFoundry was project-based. To learn about Tableau Public, I did the following project:
# Preparing for Influenza-Season
## Objective
Analyze data for the staffing needs across the US for a medical staffing agency during Influenza season
## Requirements
1. Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform medical personnel's timing and spatial distribution throughout the United States.
2. Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
does it start and end simultaneously (month) in every state?
3. Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,
medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
4. Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
## Assumptions
1. Vulnerable populations suffer the most-severe impacts from the flu and are the most likely to
end up in the hospital.
2. Flu shots decrease the chance of becoming infected with the flu.
## Data
Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender from US-[CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html)
Population data by geography and age, [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)
Counts of influenza laboratory test results by state (survey) from US-[CDC](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)
Counts of visits of patients with influenza in hospital from US-[CDC](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)
Survey of flu shot rates in children from US-[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html)
## Presentation of findings
I presented the results via an [Interim-Report](https://github.com/Gregor1000/Influenza-Season/blob/708f65ae39bdced546dafd0bb6bc6e8b8e905e77/Preparing%20for%20Influenza%20Season%20Interim%20Report.pdf) and [End-Video-Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDTl1NYc2yY) of my [Tableau-Story-Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gregor.liftinger/viz/E3A9/InfluenzaSeasonPreparation?publish=yes)
